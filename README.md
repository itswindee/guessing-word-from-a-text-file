# guessing-word-from-a-text-file

I have a text file full of random words. In this program, users will be given a list of letters and they will be prompted to enter a word of their choice using the following letters.

If it's a word in the text file, the system will alert the user that they have entered a word that's from the file.

If it's not a word in the text file, the user will be given the chance to try again until they find a word that matches.
